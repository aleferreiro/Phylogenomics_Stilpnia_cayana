# This is the code to estimate D-statistics of ABBA BABA test to assess introgression in Marajó population
# We obtained D, its significance by jacknife procedure obtaining Z-scores (higher than 3 are considered significative)
# and p-values, and lastely f-statistics (proportion of genome introgressed).

# We obtained D statistic for 
# •	P1= SAS (10 samples, 3 from WST, 4 from EST and 3 from CAA)
# •	P2= huberi (3 samples)
# •	P3= NAS (10 samples, 4 from GUY, 2 from PAR and 4 from AMA)
# •	P4=Tangara (1 sample)


# To run, locate within 13_ABBA_BABA directory

# The Dsuite tools needs the prefiltered vcf, the populations file, and a newick tree with the topology between populations (that defines P1, P2 AND P3)
# here the newick tree was defined as:
(NAS,(WST,EST));

# Then, we run Dsuite to estimate the D-stats using the following sentence: 
Dsuite/Build/Dsuite Dtrios 
	-t 01_Marajo_introgression/data/tree.nwk 
	-o 01_Marajo_introgression/result/Scay_84_24samp_bial_un_noMD 
	-n 01 
	-k 100 
	01_Marajo_introgression/data/Scay_84_24samp_bial_un_noMD.recode.vcf 
	01_Marajo_introgression/data/pops_24samp.txt

# For this first run, we used the vcf, without missing data, with biallelic SNP, and 1 SNP per locus (2187 variants)
# This perform jacknife procedure to obtain significance of D-statitics, by dividing the genomic dataset in 100 blocks (-k 100) and leaving one of them out on each resample iteration.
# The -n argument helps to define a run number to the analysis that is added to the output file names.

# After, this it will generate various files. The relevant is the _TREE as it provide D-stats for the topology we want to assess. 

# Result: D = 0.05. No significant D by Z-score (0.74), and by p-value (0.456), i.e. no gene flow signal between MJO and NAS. 
# MJO polymorphism is ancestral rather than by current gene flow.

#*********************************************
# Output files

# In [OUTPUT_NAME]_BBAA.txt, trios are arranged so that P1 and P2 always share the most derived alleles (BBAA is always the highest number). 
# There are two other output files: one with the _tree.txt suffix: [OUTPUT_NAME]_tree.txt where trios are arranged according to the tree we gave Dsuite, 
# and a file with the _Dmin.txt suffix [OUTPUT_NAME]_Dmin.txt where trios are arranged so that the D statistic is minimised - providing a kind of 
# "lower bound" on gene-flow statistics.
